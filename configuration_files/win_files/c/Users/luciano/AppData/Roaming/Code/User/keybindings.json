    // To force it you must type 2 spaces before the newline. That is contra-intuituve and I forget it a lot.
    // Bit to be confused with the real hard paragraph in markdown that is 2 newlines, but I don't like that a lot.

    // but it will catch most of this type of errors.
    // replace dot-newline with dot-space-space-newline

    // replace with regex captures $1  $2
